"""SOTA model abliteration pipeline.

Implements multiple refusal direction removal techniques drawing from:
- Arditi et al. (2024): Refusal in LLMs Is Mediated by a Single Direction
- Gabliteration (arXiv:2512.18901): SVD-based multi-direction extraction
- Norm-Preserving Biprojected Abliteration (grimjim, 2025)
- Projected Abliteration: Separating refusal vs compliance components
- Iterative refinement for cleaner orthogonalization

Novel contributions (OBLITERATUS):
- Whitened SVD direction extraction (covariance-normalized)
- True iterative refinement with re-probing between passes
- Bias term projection for complete direction removal
- Chat template wrapping for instruct model compatibility
- Cross-layer direction alignment analysis
- Logit lens refusal direction decoding
- Post-excision activation probing with Refusal Elimination Score
- Comprehensive evaluation: refusal rate, KL divergence, effective rank, CKA

        Novel contribution: instead of treating refusal removal as a flat
        linear operation across layers, Spectral Cascade decomposes the
        refusal signal into spectral frequency bands via DCT and applies
        frequency-dependent attenuation.  This separates *systematic* refusal
        (low-frequency smooth trend across many layers — the trained-in
        alignment signal) from *per-layer noise* (high-frequency spikes that
        are more likely capability-entangled artifacts).

        The algorithm has three stages:

        **Stage 1 — Direction coherence weighting.**
        For each layer, compute the cosine similarity of its refusal direction
        with its neighbors.  Layers whose refusal direction is coherent with
        adjacent layers are more likely part of the systematic refusal trend.
        This produces a per-layer coherence score in [0, 1] that modulates
        the magnitude signal before spectral decomposition.

        **Stage 2 — DCT spectral decomposition.**
        Apply a Type-II DCT to the coherence-weighted magnitude vector.
        Split the resulting coefficients into frequency bands (adaptively
        sized based on spectral energy distribution).  Low-frequency bands
        get full projection weight; high-frequency bands get attenuated.

        **Stage 3 — Cascade with early-exit.**
        Process bands from lowest to highest frequency.  After each band,
        measure remaining spectral energy.  Stop early when residual energy
        drops below ``spectral_threshold``.

        Results are stored in ``_layer_excise_weights`` to modulate
        per-layer projection strength during EXCISE.

        logits collected during the probe stage.

        Algorithm:
        1. For each MoE layer, compute continuous routing weights (softmax of
           router logits) for every prompt.
        2. For each expert, compute routing-weighted means of harmful and harmless
           activations.  Each prompt's contribution to an expert is scaled by how
           strongly the router selects that expert for that prompt.
        3. The per-expert refusal direction is the difference between the
           expert's harmful-weighted mean and harmless-weighted mean.

        This is more precise than shared-direction ablation because different
        experts may encode refusal through distinct geometric structures.
        Safety-detecting experts will have strong, distinct refusal directions;
        general-purpose experts will have weak ones.

        Also replaces static weight-alignment in _identify_safety_experts with
        dynamic routing-frequency-based classification (like SteerMoE but
        integrated with direction extraction).

        Novelty: no published work combines routing-weighted activation
        decomposition with per-expert SVD for refusal direction extraction.
        Bridges SteerMoE (expert-level analysis) with Gabliteration (multi-
        direction SVD) at per-expert granularity.

           refusal direction from its weights prevents safety-based routing.

        2. Shared experts: Always-on experts that bypass routing. In some

           42% of safety functionality (SAFEx, NeurIPS 2025).
